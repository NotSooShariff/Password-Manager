### 2. Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- [Node.js & npm (Node Package Manager)](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) 
- [Firebase account](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
- [Make](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm) (Optional) 
- A hosting provider (Optional)
  

#### Installation
1. Clone the Monolith repository from GitHub. Using the following command:
   ```
    git clone 
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory using the following commands:
   ```
    cd Password-Manager
    ```
3. Install dependencies using:
   ```
    npm install
    ```
4. Pull the database from docker:
   ```
    docker pull notsooshariff/mono-db
    ```

### 3. User Authentication

#### Firebase Setup
- Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
- Obtain Firebase API Keys (apiKey, authDomain, projectId, etc.).
- Use the `.env.template` to create a `.env.local` and paste all your API Keys there so that the app can access these variables locally. 
- Once you have set this up, you will be able to use Firebase OAUTH to Login to your Application.

### 4. Application Structure

#### Project Directory
-  The application follows a typical NextJS project's structure with the latest version
